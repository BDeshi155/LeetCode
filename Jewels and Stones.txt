771. Jewels and Stones

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
All the characters of jewels are unique.

Solution code::

import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {
        Set<Character> jewelset = new HashSet<>() ;

        for(int i = 0;i<jewels.length();i++){
            jewelset.add(jewels.charAt(i));
        }

        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<stones.length();i++){
            if(jewelset.contains(stones.charAt(i))){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        //Example 1
        String jewels1 = "aAc";
        String stones1 = "aAAbbbccCb";

        int result = solution.numJewelsInStones(jewels1,stones1);
        System.out.println(result);
