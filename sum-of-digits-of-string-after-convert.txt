You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer k.

First, convert s into an integer by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet (i.e., replace 'a' with 1, 'b' with 2, ..., 'z' with 26). Then, transform the integer by replacing it with the sum of its digits. Repeat the transform operation k times in total.

For example, if s = "zbax" and k = 2, then the resulting integer would be 8 by the following operations:

Convert: "zbax" ➝ "(26)(2)(1)(24)" ➝ "262124" ➝ 262124
Transform #1: 262124 ➝ 2 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 ➝ 17
Transform #2: 17 ➝ 1 + 7 ➝ 8
Return the resulting integer after performing the operations described above.

Example 1:

Input: s = "iiii", k = 1
Output: 36
Explanation: The operations are as follows:
- Convert: "iiii" ➝ "(9)(9)(9)(9)" ➝ "9999" ➝ 9999
- Transform #1: 9999 ➝ 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 ➝ 36
Thus the resulting integer is 36.
Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode", k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The operations are as follows:
- Convert: "leetcode" ➝ "(12)(5)(5)(20)(3)(15)(4)(5)" ➝ "12552031545" ➝ 12552031545
- Transform #1: 12552031545 ➝ 1 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 5 ➝ 33
- Transform #2: 33 ➝ 3 + 3 ➝ 6
Thus the resulting integer is 6.
Example 3:

Input: s = "zbax", k = 2
Output: 8

class Solution {
	public int getLucky(String s,int k){
		int res = convert(s);
		for(int i=0;i<k-1;i++){
			res = transform(res);
		}
		return res;
	}
	
	public int convert(String s){
		int res = 0;
		
		for (char ch: s.toCharArray()){
			res += transform(ch = 'a'+1);
		}
		return res;
	}

	public int transform(int num){
		int res = 0
		
		while (num!=0){
			res += num % 10;
			num = num/10;
		}
		return res;
	}
}

    }

Now, let's break down each part of the code:

class Solution { ... }: This is the class definition for a Java class named Solution, which contains the methods for solving the problem.

public int getLucky(String s, int k) { ... }: This is the main method that calculates the result. It takes two parameters: a string s and an integer k. It first converts the string to an integer using the convert method and then performs the transformation k-1 more times using the transform method. Finally, it returns the resulting integer.

public int convert(String s) { ... }: This method converts a given string s into an integer. It initializes a variable res to 0 and then iterates through each character of the string. Inside the loop, it converts each character to its position in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' becomes 1, 'b' becomes 2) using ch - 'a' + 1 and adds this value to res. After processing all characters, it returns the integer res.

public int transform(int num) { ... }: This method takes an integer num as input and transforms it by summing up its digits. It initializes a variable res to 0 and then enters a while loop. In each iteration of the loop, it calculates the last digit of num using num % 10, adds it to res, and then removes the last digit from num by dividing it by 10 (num = num / 10). This process continues until num becomes 0, and then it returns the resulting sum of digits in res.

The getLucky method combines these conversion and transformation steps to solve the problem and returns the final result.
